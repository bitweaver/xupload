XUpload script installation (version 2.5 26-Jan-2006)
NOTE: this script will not work properly on Windows servers!

1) Copy all files except "upload_form.html" to your cgi-bin folder (or folder where perl scripts running)
   Copy "upload_form.html" into your htdocs folder.

2) Create 2 new folders in cgi-bin for temp files and for finished uploads. 
   CHMOD them to 777 or 755 (script should have access to write into these 
   folders).

3) Modify XUploadConfig.pm file with your server details.

4) Edit upload_form.html: change URL-TO-SCRIPT to your scripts folder URL in 3 places.

That's all! Now you can go to www.yoursite.com/.../upload_form.html and start 
uploading files with XUpload.

-=[Themes]=-
You can create your own status window themes. Just use the same tags(<TMPL_VAR XXX>) from original theme file(default.html), put new file 
to Templates folder, add Theme name to XUploadConfig.pm and set value of hidden field "tmpl_name" to a name of new Theme in the upload_form.html

-=[Styles]=-
You can create your own styles too. Create new file in Styles folder, add name of new style to XUploadConfig.pm and specify it in the upload_form.html

Feel free to request new features and send us your own cool templates/styles.

Good luck!
